Welcome to Revature. Here's the plan for the first day:

Lunch 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM

Training Oboarding & Setup 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM

## Unstructured Time
I will avoid lecturing at you for 8 hours a day. Most days we will have "unstructured time" in the afternoons. The only thing I ask is that you are present and being productive during this time. We will have many things for you to spend your time on, including:
 - 


## Leetcode - Container With Most Water
Firstly, let's take a look at leetcode. This is a great web site full of code challenges. Today I want to look at the [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) challenge. As we go about making sure everyone has the access and software necessary, you might get a bit bored. I would suggest taking a look at this or other code challenges.

## Onboarding & Setup
We are going to make sure everyone has access to everything and has all necessary software installed. This will likely take the rest of the day.
