## Contracts
**I'm not familiar with the details of your contracts.**

I'm no expert in your contracts, I'm not a legal expert. I want to warn everyone, you may have heard armchair lawyers on reddit claim the contracts are "unenforceable". They are absoutely enforceable. Never listen to anyone who tells you a legally binding contract is unenforceable. Lawyers cost money, lawsuits suck, don't breach the contract. If you are planning to risk it because you think the contract is unenforceable, please just tell me you want out right away. 

I'm not familiar with the details of your contracts. Unless things have changed there is a grace period where you can back out with no trouble or penalty. That comes at the end of this week. I will let you all know when we cross that barrier, usually it's on Thursday. If you decide this training is not right for you please let me know and I will start the process of releasing you from the contract. After this week you are locked in.

I can't give you any advice about what to do about your contract, the only thing I can say is this: I signed a 2 year contract with Revature in 2021 when I was an associate in a similar situation, and I'm happy I did.

## Unstructured Time
I will avoid lecturing at you for 8 hours a day. Most days we will have "unstructured time" in the afternoons. The only thing I ask is that you are present and being productive during this time. We will have many things for you to spend your time on, including:
 - Study & Review - You should be taking notes and should review these notes regularly. I would suggest taking some time to clean them up at the end of each day.
 - Assignments - You may get some assignments from me or QC
 - Code Challenges - These are a great way to practice problem solving and syntax. I would suggest looking into Blind-75, or Grind-75 (or similar curated sets of challenges)
 - Project Work - You will have a project going throughout the training, implemented in 4 phases. Much of unstructured time will be spent working on this project

Unstructured time is not free time! You are at work, which means you need to be available for me to reach you. You should stick around on Teams and be productive with this time. Anything that furthers your goal of being trained and prepared for a new career in software engineering is being productive. 


## Leetcode - Container With Most Water
Let's take a look at leetcode. This is a great web site full of code challenges. Today I want to look at the [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) challenge. As we go about making sure everyone has the access and software necessary, you might get a bit bored. I would suggest taking a look at this or other code challenges.

## Onboarding & Setup
We are going to make sure everyone has access to everything and has all necessary software installed. This will likely take the rest of the day. This is always a painful process. IF you aren't in need of any assistance, please be patient and treat this as unstructured time.
